useEffect Hooks :- The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in a functional component. Side effects include things like fetching data from an API, updating the DOM, or subscribing to an event.
useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.

useEffect(<function>, <dependency>) OR 
useEffect(() => {
    // Side effect logic goes here
    return () => {
         // Cleanup logic (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);

üìå Why Use It?
Used when a component needs to perform side effects like:
Fetching data from an API.
Subscribing to events or timers.
Updating the document title or interacting with the DOM.
‚öôÔ∏è How It Works?
Runs after the component renders.
Can run:
Every render (no dependencies).
Only on mount ([] as dependency).
When dependencies change ([dependency]).
Cleanup function prevents memory leaks.
